# The objective of the project.

The intention of this project is to give description a bout movies i three categories. The descriptions include  cast members genre producers trailer poster released date etc.

# ****Audience of the project.****

This projects audience are people who would like to see movie discriptions.

# ****Data Collection****

Data of this project are collected from an API’s called IMDb-API ([https://imdb-api.com/](https://imdb-api.com/)).

# ****Structure**** of the project.

The first feature is to display the movies in the three categories. Most Popular , Box Office , In theaters for each category we have a container and API’s after fetching the data from the api we create a button in side it a card inside it an image and a header the button will direct as to a page of description of the movie the image will hold the the poster of the movie and the header will hold the title.

After the button is clicked all the 3 containers will be replaced with a container showing the description of the movie with the poster. This is also done with another API after the data is fetched the the grids will appear.

There are multiple buttons in this page the only functional is the trailer button. and when its clicked again every thing will be replaced with a page showing the trailer of the movie. Again this needs another api. 

Last but not list the searching feature: a very simple feature because there is an api that supports searching after the user inputs a key word the api will give us a bunch of movies that are related to that key word. After we get that data we simply need to replace every thing with the movies we got.

Note all the above features also work for searched movies,
